iOS Development with Swift
=====
In this repo you can find the slides and the examples related to the workshops I'm currently doing about Swift. In addition you will find also some examples and files related to the blog posts published on [webplatform.io](http://www.webplatform.io).

## Getting Started
In the [getting-started](https://github.com/GiorgioNatili/swift/tree/master/getting-started) folder there are the slides I used during my workshop in [General Assembly Boston](https://generalassemb.ly/education/start-building-mobile-apps-an-intro-to-ios-programming-with-swift) and some examples to get started with Swift. 
Following a list of links that I believe are very useful for people new to Swift:
